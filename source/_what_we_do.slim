              | Development of web applications is our core business. We love
                working with Ruby programming language and we use it on daily
                basis. Other technologies and frameworks are chosen individually
                for each project. From business point of view most of our work
                fall into one of the following scenarios:

              | Designing, building and maintaining server infrastructure requires
                a lot of knowledge, time and effort. We have mastered Linux server
                administration over the years. Our area of expertise are:
                automatization, virtualization, distributed network storage,
                monitoring, backups, high availability, databases and hosting
                of web applications.

            p
              | Putting a web application on-line always requires a hosting
                solution. In early 2010 we decided to develop a PaaS to support
                our customers. Now it is available to general public.
                Shelly Cloud is a complete, dedicated platform for hosting Ruby
                and Ruby on Rails applications.
